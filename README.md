# Drains-and-dungeons
This is a team repository for govHack 2015

A mobile augmented reality game using local government datasets to create a simple 'Dungeons and Dragons' hack and slash fest.

##Game Play
Connect to the game on your mobile device. As you walk around your area you will notice 'points of interest' appear on the map. Clicking on one of these will reveal the monster lurking at that point. What you do then is up to you (Fight, Flee or Find out more)

##Demo
[Drains and Dungeons](http://drains-and-dungeons.meteor.com)

##Tech
We've built this game using [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), a full stack javascript development project that uses node, mongodb and the blaze UI. None of us knew anything about it before this week, so I wouldn't be looking here for any examples of clever code :-)

If you fork or download the code you'll need to feed your server side database. The easiest way is to use the [mongorestore function](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/backup-with-mongodump/) (the dump is in the data/mongodb-backup directory)
